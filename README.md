**Drop your TONs to your Telegram group friends.**   

Telegram group members can pick up the TONs you dropped. Through this, they can pick up some of the amount you set on a first-come, first-served basis. If the members succeeds in picking it up, they can check Tonator’s profile and the amount they will receive. The amount is divided regardless of order.   


### What is Tonate?  

It’s on Me. TONs on You.
